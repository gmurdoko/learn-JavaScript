JavaScript pass by reference is different, your object is treated as a reference as long as you're changing its attributes like obj.x = 1, but assignment of the object variable itself (obj = []) will treat it as value-based variable.

In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

// Normal function - 'this' return where the function is called
// Arrow function - 'this' is return where the function is located

In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.
